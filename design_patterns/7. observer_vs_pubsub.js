// Observer Pattern:
`Definition: The Observer Pattern establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, where one object (the subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them of any changes in its state.

Communication: In the Observer Pattern, the subject directly notifies all its observers synchronously when its state changes.

Relationship: It typically involves a direct relationship between the subject and its observers.
Implementation: Observers are aware of the subject they are observing, and they are tightly coupled with it.

// Example:
- Subject: Stock Exchange
- Observers: Investors
- Scenario:
    Subject (Stock Exchange) maintains a list of observers (Investors).
    When the price of a stock changes, the Stock Exchange notifies all subscribed Investors.
    Investors receive the updates and react based on the changes in stock prices

`


// Publish-Subscribe Pattern (Pub-Sub):
`Definition: The Publish-Subscribe Pattern is a messaging pattern where message senders (publishers or topics) don't program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers (subscribers). Instead, they categorize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be.

Communication: In Pub-Sub, publishers and subscribers are decoupled. Publishers send messages to a message broker or a specific topic without knowledge of who (if anyone) is listening. Subscribers express interest in one or more topics and receive messages from the broker when they are published.

Relationship: It facilitates a more indirect relationship between publishers and subscribers, often mediated by a message broker or a central topic.
Implementation: Subscribers are unaware of the publishers, and publishers are unaware of the subscribers. They interact through a message broker or a central topic.


// Example:
- Publishers: Users posting tweets
- Subscribers: Users following specific hashtags
- Message Broker: Twitter's backend system
- Scenario:
    Publishers (Users) post tweets with hashtags.
    Subscribers (Users) follow specific hashtags.
    When a tweet with a hashtag is published, it is sent to Twitter's backend system (Message Broker).
    The Message Broker distributes the tweet to all users who have subscribed to that hashtag, ensuring they receive the tweet in real-time.

// Similarities:
`Both patterns enable communication between objects without tight coupling, promoting flexibility and modularity in software design.
They both facilitate one-to-many communication scenarios, where multiple objects can react to changes or events triggered by one object.
Both patterns are used to manage dependencies and establish dynamic relationships between components in an application.`

// Differences:
`The Observer Pattern typically involves a direct relationship between subjects and observers, whereas the Pub-Sub Pattern facilitates a more indirect, mediated relationship between publishers and subscribers.
Pub-Sub introduces an intermediary (message broker or central topic) between publishers and subscribers, allowing for more decoupled communication.
The Observer Pattern is more suitable for scenarios where objects need to be aware of each other, while Pub-Sub is more suitable for scenarios where loose coupling and scalability are priorities.
In summary, while the Observer Pattern and the Pub-Sub Pattern share common goals, they have different approaches and are suitable for different use cases based on the level of decoupling and scalability required in the application architecture.`
